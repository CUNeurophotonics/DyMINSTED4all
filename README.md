# DyminSTED4all
Open source instructions and code for making your STED microscope a Dymin STED

## Description

Using inexpensive parts and labview code, we implemented Dymin STED Microscopy as detailed from in the paper: [Adaptive Illumination STED Nanoscopy](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/37/9797).  The following files include our code, parts list and instructions to set up.
